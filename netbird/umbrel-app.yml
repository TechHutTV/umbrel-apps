  NetBird is a fast and secure mesh VPN that allows you to connect your devices from anywhere.
  It is built on top of WireGuardÂ® and uses a peer-to-peer architecture to create a flat network between your machines.
  This makes it easy to access your Umbrel from anywhere, without having to configure port forwarding or a traditional VPN.

  To get started, you will need a NetBird account or a self-hosted instance. You can sign up for a free account at https://app.netbird.io/.
  Once you have an account, you will need to create a setup key. You can do this by going to the "Setup Keys" tab in the NetBird dashboard.
