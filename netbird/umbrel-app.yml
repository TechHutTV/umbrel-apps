  NetBird is a fast and secure mesh VPN that allows you to connect your devices from anywhere.
  It is built on top of WireGuardÂ® and uses a peer-to-peer architecture to create a flat network between your machines.
  This makes it easy to access your Umbrel from anywhere, without having to configure port forwarding or a traditional VPN.

  To get started, you will need a NetBird account. You can sign up for a free account at https://app.netbird.io/.
  Once you have an account, you will need to create a setup key. You can do this by going to the "Setup Keys" tab in the NetBird dashboard.
  You will also need to provide the management URL, which you can find in the "Settings" tab of the NetBird dashboard.
